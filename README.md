# deepQnet
deep Q-network sim with gui in python


This project is very much still a work in progress.
I am still actively developing this and will commit 
changes when i have stable updates. Expect strange bugs,
odd emergent behaviour, and agents that often yeet themselves
into the nearest obstacle.

Any and all feedback and suggestions are appreciated.
Always looking for a good team to work with!

Thanks for checking out my code

Enjoy
